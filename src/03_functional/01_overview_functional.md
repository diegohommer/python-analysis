# Overview of Functional Programming in Python

This folder demonstrates Python’s functional programming features:

- Anonymous functions (lambda)
- Immutability and avoiding side-effects
- Recursion
- Higher-order functions (map, filter, reduce)
- Pattern matching (Python 3.10+)

Each `.py` file contains runnable examples to illustrate functional programming concepts.
