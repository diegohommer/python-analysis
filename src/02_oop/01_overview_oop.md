# Overview of Object-Oriented Programming in Python

This folder demonstrates Python’s object-oriented features:

- Classes and objects
- Encapsulation and access control
- Inheritance (single, multiple, and mixins)
- Composition
- Modules and packages
- Polymorphism (ad-hoc and universal)
- Delegates / callable objects

Each `.py` file contains examples that can be run to see Python OOP in action.
