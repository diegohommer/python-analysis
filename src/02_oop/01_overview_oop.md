# Overview of Object-Oriented Programming in Python

This folder demonstrates Python’s object-oriented features with small, runnable examples:

- **Classes and objects** (`02_classes.py`) – creating and using Python classes.
- **Encapsulation and access control** (`03_encapsulation.py`) – private/protected attributes and getters/setters.
- **Inheritance, mixins, and ABCs** (`04_inheritance.py`) – single and multiple inheritance, `super()`, abstract base classes, and mixins.
- **Composition** (`05_composition.py`) – classes containing other objects to delegate behavior.
- **Polymorphism**
  - Ad-hoc polymorphism (`06_polymorphism_ad_hoc.py`) – method overriding in subclasses.
  - Universal polymorphism (`07_polymorphism_universal.py`) – duck typing and callable objects.
- **Modules and packages** (`08_organization/`) – organizing code with `.py` files and packages with `__init__.py`.
- **Delegation and callbacks** (`09_delegation.py`) – passing functions, methods, or callable objects as arguments.
- **Properties and decorators** (`10_decorators.py`) – `@property` for elegant getters/setters, `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod` for class-level and independent methods.

Each `.py` file contains examples that can be run to see Python OOP concepts in action.
